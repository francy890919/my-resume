        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p>
            Hello, I am Francy. I am a fifth year student at NTHU in TW with a major in Quantitative finance and a minor in Data Science program. I currently attend an exchange program at Seoul National University in South Korea to continue refining my expertise. <br />

So far, I have completed my internships as a Cybersecurity Engineer at PwC, a Project Consultant at Shopee, and an Administrative Assistant at NTHU's Office of Global Affair. Thanks to lots of professional exploration during my internship tenures, I eventually found my passion lied in the qualities I have cultivated through programming. <br />

For the next chapter of my journey, I will go to University of Chicago to pursue my master's degree in Computer Science. I would like to study further particularly in ML and AI fields. By taking advantage of my robust mathematical intuition and extensive knowledge of statistics, I will devoted myself to creating a better future for human beings relying on data science. <br />

 I will appreciate any opportunity, connection, and collaboration from you. Thank you :)
